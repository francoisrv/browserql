# browserql

Use graphql in the browser ðŸš€

## Abstract

Wouldn't it be cool to use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) as a state manager for browser apps?

Or have you ever worked in a front-end app that does not use GraphQL as a back-end and end up missing using Apollo to handle your state?

### Introducing browserql

You could benefit from GraphQL's schema syntax to model your data, and [Apollo's cache](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-interaction/) to store your data dynamically.

You could use as a drop-in replacement for other state managements solutions such as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

Note that this is a solution in case you are **not** using GraphQL already in the back-end -- even though it should be possible to use both.

Use this for any other back-end management (http, sockets) -- or none at all.
